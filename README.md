### Detail Implements

[Android列表视频播放开发之路](http://www.jianshu.com/p/4db96418f32b)


 * Define a [IViewTrakcer](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/IViewTracker.java) to track the view

 * Define [FloatLayerView](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/FloatLayerView.java) added into {@link android.view.Window#ID_ANDROID_CONTENT} decor view

    ```java
     * It contains:
     * 1. rootLayout which hold all views to be added in {@link FloatLayerView},height must be WRAP_CONTENT
     * 2. {@link #mVideoTopView} that play video
     * 3. {@link #mVideoBottomView} in bottom layer of {@link #mVideoPlayerView}, which can be used to add some mask view...
     * 4. {@link #mVideoTopView} in top layer of {@link #mVideoPlayerView},which can add some video controller view...
    ```

 * Define [IScrollDetector](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/scrolldetector/IScrollDetector.java) to observer scroll state

 * Define [IControllerView](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/videomanage/controller/IControllerView.java) added in [FloatLayerView](!https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/FloatLayerView.java)
  ```java
        /**
        * Normal video controller view added in {@link com.brucetoo.videoplayer.VideoTracker#mVideoTopView}
        * when attach to portrait(normal) tracker view
        */
       View normalScreenController(IViewTracker tracker);
       /**
        * Detail video controller view added in {@link com.brucetoo.videoplayer.VideoTracker#mVideoTopView}
        * when attach to detail tracker view
        */
       View detailScreenController(IViewTracker tracker);
       /**
        * Full screen video controller view added in {@link com.brucetoo.videoplayer.VideoTracker#mVideoTopView}
        * when attach to landscape screen
        */
       View fullScreenController(IViewTracker tracker);
       /**
        * Loading state controller view added in {@link com.brucetoo.videoplayer.VideoTracker#mVideoTopView}
        * when video is preparing
        */
       View loadingController(IViewTracker tracker);

       /**
        * Another controller view need be added in {@link com.brucetoo.videoplayer.VideoTracker#mVideoTopView}
        */
       View anotherController(IViewTracker tracker);

  ```

## USAGE

### Tracker

   * Tracker attach

   ```java

    Tracker
         .attach(activity) // A activity only has a single IViewTracker
         .trackView(trackView) // Set track view,let IViewTracker's getFollowerView() can observe it scroll change
         .into(IScrollDetector) // Observe tracker view's parent scroll state change, see demo in ListScrollDetector
         .controller(IControllerView)// Switch video controller view in different scene,see demo in DefaultControllerView
         .visibleListener(this);// Observe tracker view visible rect changed in screen.
   ```
   > **NOTE**: [IScrollDetector](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/scrolldetector/IScrollDetector.java) and [IControllerView](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/videomanage/controller/IControllerView.java) will still **BE THE SAME** when change tracker view by [Tracker#changeTrackView](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/Tracker.java#L108)
    unless we re-call [Tracker#into](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/IViewTracker.java#L79) or [Trakcer#controller](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/IViewTracker.java#L88) again to bind new one

   * Tracker detach

   ```java
    Tracker.detach(getActivity()); //just remove all view in decor view
   ```

   * Tracker destroy

   ```java
    Tracker.destroy(getActivity()); //remove all view in decor view and clear all instanses
   ```

   * Change tracker view

   ```java
   Tracker.changeTrackView(getActivity(),newTrackerView);// re-bound to new tracker view
   ```

### Video Play Control

   * Register item changed listener

   ```java
        Tracker.addPlayerItemChangeListener(this);
   ```

   * Register video play listener

   ```java
        Tracker.addVideoPlayerListener(this);
   ```

   * Start play new one with [MetaData](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/videomanage/meta/MetaData.java)

   ```java
        Tracker.playNewVideo(this, mVideoPlayView, mMetaData.getVideoUrl());
   ```
   >  [MetaData](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/videomanage/meta/MetaData.java) can bind origin date information along with [IViewTracler](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/videoplayer/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/videoplayer/IViewTracker.java)


   * Stop playing one

   ```java
        Tracker.stopAnyPlayback();
   ```


All Demo you can see in [ListSupportFragment](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/listvideoplay/demo/ListSupportFragment.java) and [DetailFragment](https://github.com/brucetoo/ListVideoPlay/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/brucetoo/listvideoplay/demo/DetailFragment.java)

## Known issues

   * When tracker view be re-used in ListView/RecyclerView may cause **re-tracked**
